She had to make an effort before he touched her, then as she came, he declared the work done. woman though art loosed from thy infirmity. He counted it done before it manifested.","First_Name":"Jesus","Last_Name":"Biblical Miracle","Email":null,"Believer_Before":null,"church_affiliated":null,"race":null,"COB":null,"CNOB":null,"Location_city":null,"Location_country":null,"Scriptures":null,"event":null,"forgiveness":null,"region":"13","who_healed":null,"time_of_effect":null,"Miracle_Type":"1","gender":null,"Display":"1"}},{"type":"Feature","id":20,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.5765057535527,32.8803761827969]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":20,"GlobalID":"708321f9-067b-4f99-ba5a-14a6b7837a09","CreationDate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2020 20:55:33 GMT","Creator":"Gwen@miraclemapper.com","EditDate":"Tue, 05 May 2020 20:05:40 GMT","Editor":"Gwen@miraclemapper.com","Condition":"28","Location":"Capernaum Israel","Date_of_miracle":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 04:00:00 GMT","New_Mindset":"How this made you feel","links":"https://youtu.be/97a0fLC4S-0","Name":"Centurion's Servant","Comments_":"Only recorded in Matthew.
